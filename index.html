            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Florida studying web design and development. I am enjoying
                my first semester and hope to learn more as the weeks pass. I have many interests, hobbies, and
                aspirations that sometimes feel impossible to achieve in one lifetime. Nevertheless, I will prevail.</p>

        <div class="content-text career-text">
            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>My main career goal is never having to work hard in my life. That said, I want to test my ability in
                every field or at least those with activity. I am frustrated with working from behind a desk and seeing
                the same people daily. Ideally, I would like to travel and explore different countries with a face full
                of food, hoping to make money from it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-text hobbies-text">
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>My hobbies include walking a few miles daily, playing console games, photography, and other forms of
                content creation. Watching horror movies also helps me get through when times feel slow or when I need
                comfort. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-text interests-text">
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I have an interest in food, gaming, streaming content, exploring news about astronomy, and other things
                that are space related.
